    "\n",
    "    Strengths: Highest GDP growth rate at 7.58%, indicating strong economic expansion and potential for high returns.\n",
    "    Challenges: High inflation rate at 6.95%, which could impact purchasing power and consumer spending.\n",
    "    Stock Market: Positive growth trajectory driven by infrastructure and private investment.\n",

    "USA\n",
    "\n",
    "    Strengths: Moderate inflation rate at 4.12% and the lowest unemployment rate at 3.63%, indicating a stable economic environment and strong labor market.\n",
    "    Challenges: Lower GDP growth rate at 2.54% compared to India and China.\n",
    "    Stock Market: Robust performance, particularly in technology, reflecting economic resilience.\n",

    "China\n",
    "\n",
    "    Strengths: Low inflation rate at 0.23%, suggesting a stable cost of living and strong purchasing power.\n",
