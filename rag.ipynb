    "Research Current Tariffs: Identified tariffs still in effect, including those on solar panels, steel, aluminum, and Chinese goods.\n",
    "Identify Affected Industries: Recognized key industries impacted by these tariffs, such as technology, automotive, manufacturing, solar energy, and consumer electronics.\n",
    "Analyze Financial Reports: Reviewed financial metrics of major companies in affected industries, focusing on revenue, profit margins, and cost structures.\n",
    "Remaining Steps:\n",
    "Summarize Findings: Compile a comprehensive summary of the impact of tariffs on U.S. companies, highlighting key insights from the financial analysis and industry research.\n",
    "Final Summary:\n",
    "The tariffs imposed during the Trump administration, which remain in effect, continue to impact several key industries in the United States. These include the technology, automotive, manufacturing, solar energy, and consumer electronics sectors.\n",
    "Technology Industry: Companies like Apple have shown resilience with strong profit margins despite increased costs from tariffs on Chinese electronics.\n",
    "Automotive Industry: Tesla faces challenges with earnings and free cash flow, likely due to tariffs on steel and aluminum, which increase production costs.\n",
    "Manufacturing and Solar Energy: Companies in these sectors, such as Ford and SunPower, are also affected by tariffs, impacting their cost structures and competitiveness.\n",
    "Overall, while some companies have managed to maintain growth and profitability, others face significant financial pressures due to increased costs and supply chain disruptions. The ongoing tariffs continue to shape the strategic decisions and financial health of U.S. companies across these industries.\n",
    "This analysis provides a clear understanding of the current economic landscape for U.S. companies affected by tariffs, offering insights into their financial performance and strategic challenges.\n",
